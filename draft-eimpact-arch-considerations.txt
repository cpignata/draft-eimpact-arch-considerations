1.  Introduction

   Sustainability is an important consideration in networking.  Both for
   ensuring that networking technology can enable societies to operate
   in a sustainable manner and that the networks themselves are
   sustainable.

   This document discusses protocol and network architecture aspects
   that may have an impact on the sustainability of network technology.

   Where good design and architecture can improve the sustainability of
   networks, we should of course apply them when designing new protocols
   and building networks.

   But what is such good design and architecture?  Are there guidelines
   that can be given?  Intuitively, protocol and network architecture
   may in some cases have an impact on sustainability.  At the very
   least the right design and architecture can make it possible to have
   a positive impact, but of course the architecture alone is not
   enough.  The possibilities offered by the architecture need to be
   employed by implementations and practical deployments.

   To give an example of architectural aspect that potentially has a
   sustainability impact, enabling the collection of information (e.g.,
   energy consumption data) and then using that information to make
   smarter decisions is one.  Other examples include making it possible
   to scale resources or resource selection processes performed in a
   sustainability-aware fashion.  The use of communication primitives
   that maximise utility in a given problem (e.g., using multicast) or
   the use technologies that reduce the number or size of messages
   needed for a given task (e.g., binary encoding instead of textual)
   are some further examples.

   But there are likely also often tradeoffs, such as side-effects of
   architectural choices, e.g., dynamic scaling of a router network
   potentially impacting jitter.

   This document discusses some of these architectural aspects and
   considerations related to them, and tries to give guidance where such
   guidance can be given.

   The scope of the document is advice on Internet and protocol
   architecture, such as what architecture or capabilities new protocol
   designs or features should have, what kind of operational network
   architectures should be deployed, and how all of these can be
   designed to best address sustainability concerns.

   The document is intended to help engineering efforts in the IETF,
   provide guidance for operationals in the operator community, or point
   to research directions in the IRTF.

   This document is not focused on general issues around sustainability,
   except those that pertain to architecture or significant protocol
   features.
