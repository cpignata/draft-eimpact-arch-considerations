1.  Introduction

   Protocol and network architecture can have an impact on
   sustainability.  At the very least the right architecture can make it
   possible to have a positive impact, but of course the architecture
   alone is not enough.  The possibilities offered by the architecture
   need to be employed by implementations and practical deployments.

   To give some examples of architectural aspects that potentially have
   a sustainability impacts, these can be about enabling information
   (e.g., energy consumption data) and using that information, making
   dynamic scaling of resources possible, resource selection performed
   in a sustainability-aware fashion, unicast vs. multicast
   architectures, textual vs. binary encoding, and improvements in the
   chattiness of protocols.

   But there are also often tradeoffs, such as side-effects of
   architectural choices, e.g., dynamic scaling of a router network
   potentially impacting jitter.

   This document discusses some of these architectural aspects and
   considerations related to them.

2.  Security Considerations
